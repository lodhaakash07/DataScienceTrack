#Instruction for the Project
Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

    *Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    *Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    *Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    *Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
    *Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 

# Files in the repository
	* run_analysis.R - Contains the R code for processing the data and converting it into a tidy data
	* getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip - Contains the Original zipped Dataset
  	* UCI HAR Dataset - Extracted DataSet
	* CodeBook.md - Description of the Project, features of the dataset and how to use the repository
