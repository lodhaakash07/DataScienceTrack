# Quiz 1


# Question 1
# Which of the following is a principle of analytic graphics?
    # Only do what your tools allow you to do
    # Don't plot more than two variables at at time
    # Show box plots (univariate summaries)
    # Show multivariate data - ANS
    # Make judicious use of color in your scatterplots


# Question 2
# What is the role of exploratory graphs in data analysis?
    # They are used in place of formal modeling.
    # They are typically made very quickly. - ANS
    # Axes, legends, and other details are clean and exactly detailed.
    # They are made for formal presentations.

# Question 3
# Which of the following is true about the base plotting system?
    # The system is most useful for conditioning plots
    # Plots are created and annotated with separate functions -aNS
    # Plots are typically created with a single function call
    # Margins and spacings are adjusted automatically depending on the type of plot and the data'


# Question 4
# Which of the following is an example of a valid graphics device in R?
    # A PDF file -ANS
    # A file folder
    # The keyboard
    # A socket connection


# Question 5
# Which of the following is an example of a vector graphics device in R?
    # JPEG
    # SVG -ANS
    # PNG
    # GIF


# Question 6
# Bitmapped file formats can be most useful for
    # Plots that are not scaled to a specific resolution 
    # Plots that require animation or interactivity
    # Scatterplots with many many points
    # Plots that may need to be resized -ANS


# Question 7
# Which of the following functions is typically used to add elements to a plot in the base graphics system?
    # hist()
    # plot()
    # boxplot()
    # lines() -ANS

# Question 8
# Which function opens the screen graphics device for the Mac?
    # bitmap()
    # png()
    # quartz() 0ANS
    # pdf()


# Question 9
# What does the 'pch' option to par() control?
# the plotting symbol/character in the base graphics system -ANS
# the size of the plotting symbol in a scatterplot
# the line width in the base graphics system
# the orientation of the axis labels on the plot


# Question 10
# If I want to save a plot to a PDF file, which of the following is a correct way of doing that?
    # Open the PostScript device with postscript(), construct the plot, then close the device with dev.off().
    # Open the screen device with quartz(), construct the plot, and then close the device with dev.off().
    # Construct the plot on the screen device and then copy it to a PDF file with dev.copy2pdf()  -ANS
    # Construct the plot on the PNG device with png(), then copy it to a PDF with dev.copy2pdf()
